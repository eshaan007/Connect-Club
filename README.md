# Connect-Club
An *online platform* to connect with other classmates. :wave:

It is made using PHP, MySQL, Ajax, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. :zap:

It is useful for solving doubts among peers and friends while not disturbing the class. :speak_no_evil: It helps in inculcating the discipline among students during lectures and stop the urge to speak with friends. 🤫

Made only for **Educational Purposes** !! :man_technologist:

## Working of the Application : 

To Register for the first time, the user has to provide their **Name**, ***email***, **password** and another column with their **new password** and **gender** column for setting the default image. :lock:

For verification, an *email* will be sent which the user has to click in order to **initialize the application**. :email: :unlock:

Once the user has signed up, The *Login page* will contain only 2 parameters i.e., **emailID** and the **password**.:new: :key:
It will be rendered using *server-side scripts*. 

After completing all these steps, the user will be *directed to the Lobby*. :ok_hand:

### In the Lobby, there are 4 main options to choose from :
- Create ➕
- People 👬
- My Clubs 🏠
- Settings ⚙️

#### Create Page ➕ : 
On this page, the User has to create a new "Connect-Club" in which he/she has to enter the following parameters : *name of the **Chat-Club**, password and the type of Chat-Club - Private or Public*.

After the creation of the Club, *an encrypted link* will be created which can be sent to the other people to be admitted in this Club. Then the admin himself can join the club from the **My Clubs** section in the Lobby. 

#### Join Page :
On this page, the User can join a particular Chat-Club if it already exists in the Database by entering the *name of the **Chat-Club**, password and the type of Chat-Club.*

After joining, he will be greeted to the page where the conversation can begin in the clubs.

#### My Clubs Page : 
This page shows a list of the Clubs you have joined and we can either **Enter** the Club or **Delete** the Club. There is also an option for the people who haven't joined any other Club to join a *new Club*.

#### Settings Menu : 
This pop-up will let you choose from a range of 5 different colors.\
It also has a Feature to change your UserName from the one set by default.\
The Password can also be changed but it requires to be put twice and the previous password also has to be typed in for changing it.
